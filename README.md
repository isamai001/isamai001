             Technical Skills 


             

              Languages

   Java  
A versatile object-oriented programming language used to build robust backend systems, Android applications, and enterprise-level solutions. I use it for logic-heavy systems and full application development.

  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 

The fundamental structure of web pages. I use HTML to build layouts and organize website content across all web projects.

 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  

Used to style and design websites. I apply CSS to make web interfaces responsive, attractive, and consistent across devices.

JavaScript  

A client-side scripting language that enables interactivity in websites. I use JavaScript for DOM manipulation, form validation, dynamic UI changes, and animations.

PHP (Basics)  

A backend scripting language used mainly for server-side logic. I’ve applied PHP for basic CRUD operations, contact forms, and user session handling.

 SQL (Structured Query Language)  

A standard language for managing and querying relational databases. I use SQL to create tables, retrieve records, and handle database logic in projects that require persistent storage.

        Frameworks and Libraries

   Spring Boot  

A Java-based framework for building REST APIs and microservices. I’m learning and applying Spring Boot for secure, scalable backend systems.

  Bootstrap  

A CSS framework that simplifies the design process by offering pre-designed components. I use Bootstrap for building mobile-responsive, clean UIs quickly.

  jQuery  

A JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with the DOM, handle events, and manage animations. I use jQuery to simplify client-side scripting tasks.

   React (Learning)  

A modern JavaScript library for building fast, dynamic frontends with reusable components. I’m currently learning React to create interactive, state-managed user interfaces.

    Tools and Platforms

   Git 

A version control tool that helps manage code changes and collaborations across projects. I use Git to track progress, experiment safely, and work in teams.

   GitHub  

A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories. I use GitHub to publish my projects, maintain portfolios, and collaborate on code with others.

   Firebase 

A platform by Google offering backend services such as real-time databases and user authentication. I use Firebase in projects that require fast, cloud-based backend support.

   VS Code (Visual Studio Code) 

My main code editor for web and general-purpose programming. Offers excellent extension support and debugging capabilities.

  IntelliJ IDEA  

A powerful Java IDE. I use IntelliJ for larger-scale Java applications due to its intelligent code assistance and integrated build tools.

   NetBeans  

An alternative Java IDE used during my university projects. Suitable for smaller or academic Java-based applications.

   XAMPP  

A local server environment for testing PHP, MySQL, and Apache-based web applications. I use it to simulate live environments for development.

  Postman 

An API testing and documentation tool. I use Postman to send requests to backend endpoints, debug API responses, and test REST services.
